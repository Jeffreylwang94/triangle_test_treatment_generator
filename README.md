# triangle_test_treatment_generator

Simple script to generate some treatments for discrimination testing I was doing to determine whether the settings of my rice cooker made a difference between quick vs normal cook.

Given a number of tasters, will generate random combinations of treatments A and B, evenly distributing all treatment possibilities within whole groups of six out of the total testers.
